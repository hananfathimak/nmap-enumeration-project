# Nmap Enumeration Project

This project demonstrates a complete Nmap scanning workflow performed as part of my cybersecurity learning on TryHackMe.

## üìå Project Description

The goal of this project was to learn and practice network reconnaissance using Nmap. The scans were executed on a controlled lab environment (TryHackMe AttackBox and target machine). Each step focused on a specific enumeration objective.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Nmap
- TryHackMe AttackBox (Kali Linux)

## üß≠ Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Host Discovery
**Command:**
```
nmap -sn <target-ip>
```
**Purpose:**
Identify whether the host is online and reachable.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Full TCP SYN Port Scan
**Command:**
```
nmap -sS -p- <target-ip>
```
**Purpose:**
Scan all 65,535 TCP ports to find open ports.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Service Version Detection
**Command:**
```
nmap -sV -p <ports> <target-ip>
```
**Purpose:**
Determine what services are running on the open ports and their versions.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Script Scan
**Command:**
```
nmap -sC -sV -p <ports> <target-ip>
```
**Purpose:**
Run Nmap default scripts to collect additional information and check for common misconfigurations.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ OS Detection
**Command:**
```
nmap -O -p <ports> <target-ip>
```
**Purpose:**
Attempt to identify the target operating system.

## üìÑ Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience performing network enumeration with Nmap.
- Learned how to interpret scan results, including:
  - Open ports and services
  - Service versions
  - OS fingerprinting
  - Basic script output
